## Introduction

bigshot is an open source synthetic tool with AWS Lambda.
With `bigshot`, you can easily do healthcheck from all regions in AWS. Bigshot saves result of each API call in DynamoDB if you want to gather. 


## Why bigshot

### **- Checking APIs in AWS regions **
- If you are running resources in the cloud, it is not easily to gather all resources because resources keeps changing every day.
If there are more than one account, then this problem is way more critical in terms of security.
So, you need to gather resource list when you want to audit with one command, and `bigshot` is what you are looking for.
